# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Supabase credentials

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Start the app


   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Supabase Schema

The `supabase` directory contains SQL for additional tables used by the app. Run the SQL in `supabase/schema.sql` on your project to create the `user_roles` table which stores roles for each user. The table now references `auth.users` and the script uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` to avoid duplicates. If you previously created an older `user_roles` table, drop it before running the updated SQL.

### Admin pages

The admin interface is implemented in `app/(web)/admin.tsx` and there is no `app/admin` directory. Users without the admin role visiting this page will see an "Access denied" message.
